Exercises\n4. What can you do with the Julia programming language?\n    - Scientific Modelling\n    - Fast Linear Algebra\n\n### Learning Goals\n\nAfter this workshop you should:\n\n1. Be familiar with Julia syntax.\n2. Understand variables, functions, and basic data types in Julia.\n3. Be able to write short programs in Julia.\n4. Feel confident enough to explore more on your own.\n\n# What is Julia?\n\n> **The Julia Project as a whole is about bringing usable, scalable technical computing to a greater audience**: allowing scientists and researchers to use computation more rapidly and effectively; letting businesses do harder and more interesting analyses more easily and cheaply.\n> Part of that project entails creating a free, open-source language that is as easy to use as possible, so that researchers who are not necessarily professional programmers can easily create and share programs that others will be able to use for free and improve upon.\n> However, a large part of the project is also about creating an ecosystem in which such openness and sharing can take place.\n\n-- [Julia Project page](https://julialang.org/project/)\n\n### Why should I care?\n\n1. It is easy to prototype *fast*, *idiomatic* code in Julia *at a high level* thanks to Julia's JIT compiler and powerful type system.\n2. Julia favors a generic programming style: write functions that assume as little as possible and compose them to write powerful programs.\n3. The Julia community is open and highly collaborative. Many high profile packages represent the joint effort of several brilliant people.\n\n### How is it different from `xxxxx`?\n\nSyntax comparison between MATLAB, Julia, and Python: https://cheatsheets.quantecon.org/\nThe Julia manual has a dedicated package on this: https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/noteworthy-differences/\n\n### I like `X/Y/Z` from `xxxxx` language. I don't think I can ever switch.\n\nEarly on in the development of Julia, people put effort into building interoperability between Julia and other languages.\nThis means that if you really need a package implemented in another language, it is possible to use it directly from within Julia.\n\n**Examples**\n\n- Python: Use [PyCall.jl](https://github.com/JuliaPy/PyCall.jl). \n- R: Use [RCall.jl](https://github.com/JuliaInterop/RCall.jl).\n- MATLAB: Use [MATLAB.jl](https://github.com/JuliaInterop/MATLAB.jl).\n- FORTRAN or C: Use the built-in `ccall` function documented [here](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/calling-c-and-fortran-code/).\n- C++: Use [Cxx.jl](https://github.com/JuliaInterop/Cxx.jl).\n\nThe [JuliaInterop](https://github.com/JuliaInterop) organization has more packages available for other languages.\n\n**Ultimately, the Julia language is (a very useful) tool. You should use whatever makes you productive, and your work reproducible.**\n\n# Basics\n\n### Tools to write Julia code\n\nJulia program files end with the `.jl` file extension.\nThere are two environments people generally use to write Julia code:\n\n1. An *interactive* environment lets you input commands and gives you feedback as you work. For example, Julia comes with its own **REPL (Read-Evaluation-Print Loop)** that operates in a command line fashion. \n2. A *non-interactive* environment executes a series of commands (program) in the background without any feedback. Error messages, due to logical errors or program state, are generally handled by the program itself.\n\n**Programs** or **scripts** are usually, but not always, non-interactive in that they are used to automate long tasks without active control from a user.\n\nHere we will focus on how to work within a Jupyter notebook.\nMuch of what we do here will carry over to working in a REPL.\n\n### Jupyter notebooks\n\nThis notebook is made up of different cells:\n\n1. **Code cells** contain a series of instructions (in Julia). You can run them by clicking the run button, entering `Ctrl + Enter`.\n2. **Markdown cells** contain text that can be formatted with [Markdown](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/Notebook/Working%20With%20Markdown%20Cells.html). They may contain text, images, LaTeX equations.\n\nAfter selecting a cell (highlighted in green):\n\n* You can insert a new cell (code cell by default) by typing `Esc` followed by `A` (insert above) or `Esc` followed by `B` (insert below).\n* Convert it to a code cell using `Esc` then `Y`.\n* Convert it to a Markdown cell using `Esc` then `M`.\n\n**Exercise**: Convert the following cell into a code cell and run it.\n\nsqrt(2)\n\nAnother tip: You can toggle code lines with `Esc`, `L`.\n\n### Getting Around\n\nSo far we don't really know how to do anything in Julia. Thankfully, there is a built-in help system. You can access it by entering `?`:"
