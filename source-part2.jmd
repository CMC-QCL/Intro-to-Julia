### Newtons' Method

Newton's method, also known as the Newton-Raphsons method, is an *iterative* technique that computes *roots* of a given function by exploiting information about its shape.
A root of $f$, or a zero of $f$, is simply a value $x$ such that $f(x) = 0$.
Given a function $f$ with derivative $f^\prime$, the algorithm can be summarized succintly as
$$
\underset{\text{next value in sequence}}{x_{k+1}}
=
\underset{\text{current value in sequence}}{x_{k}}
-
\underset{\text{Newton direction}}{\frac{ f(x_{k}) }{ f^\prime(x_{k}) }}.
$$
Starting from some initial guess for the root, $x_{0}$, one applies the rule above several times until the procedure converges to some specified tolerance level.


```julia
function newton(f, df, x0; niters::Int=100, tol::Real=1e-2)
    # initialize
    f_init  = f(x0)                      # initial value for function values, f(x_0)
    df_init = df(x0)                     # initial value for derivative values, f'(x_0)
    f_prev  = typemax(f_init)            # previous function value, f(x_k)
    f_cur   = f_init                     # current function value, f(x_k+1)
    df_prev = typemax(f_init)            # previous function value, f'(x_k)
    df_cur  = df_init                    # current function value, f'(x_k+1)
    T = typeof(one(f_cur) / one(f_prev)) # infer common type
    x = convert(T, x0)                   # current iterate
    converged  = false                   # indicates whether we have achieved required tolerance
    iterations = 0                       # track the number of iterations taken

    for iter in 1:niters
        # iterate
        x_prev = x
        x = x - f_cur / df_cur

        # update state
        f_prev  = f_cur
        df_prev = df_cur
        f_cur   = f(x)
        df_cur  = df(x)

        # check convergence
        converged = abs(f_cur - f_prev) < tol * (f_prev + 1)
        iterations += 1

        converged && break
    end

    return (x, iterations, converged)
end
```


```julia
g(x) = x^2
dg(x) = 2*x
newton(g, dg, 4.0, tol=1e-16)
```

### Handling Derivatives

But what if you don't know all the calculus rules, or your function simply has a derivative that is hard to write down?

Fortunately, there are a number of techniques to
- compute derivatives exactly (automatic differentation),
- derive symbolic expressions (symbolic differentiation), and
- approximate derivatives numerically (finite differences).


```julia
f(x) = tan(x)^2
```

#### Exact derivatives with ForwardDiff.jl


```julia
using ForwardDiff
```


```julia
fderiv1(x) = ForwardDiff.derivative(f, x)
```


```julia
f(2)
```


```julia
fderiv1(2)
```


```julia
xs = range(-1, 1, step=1e-2)
plot(xs, [f, fderiv1],
    label=["f(x)" "f'(x)"],
    legend=:outerright,
    linewidth=3,
)
```

#### Approximate derivatives with FiniteDifferences.jl


```julia
using FiniteDifferences
```


```julia
fderiv2(x) = FiniteDifferences.central_fdm(2, 1)(f, x)
```


```julia
f(2)
```


```julia
fderiv2(2)
```


```julia
xs = range(-1, 1, step=1e-2)
plot(xs, [f, fderiv2],
    label=["f(x)" "f'(x)"],
    legend=:outerright,
    linewidth=3,
)
```

#### Automatic Differenations vs Finite Differences


```julia
abs(fderiv1(2) - fderiv2(2))
```

### Exercise: Write a function that compares forward mode AD with central finite differences.

#### Inputs:
- A function, call it `f`.
- A list of values, `xvalues`, at which to compare the two methods.

#### Outputs:

A single `DataFrame` with the following columns:

- `x`, which denotes the value at which to evalute the requested quantities.
- `f`, which represents the function value at a given point `x`.
- `FAD`, the value of the derivative based on ForwardDiff.jl.
- `CFD`, the value of the derivative based on the central differences method in FiniteDifferences.jl.
- `diff`, the absolute difference between the two methods.

**Bonus**

- Sort the data in ascending order based on the `x` column.
- Avoid the `push!` operation in the given `for` loop.
- Avoid writing an explicit `for` loop.


```julia
function compare_derivatives(f, xvalues)
    # 1. Create objects that represent derivatives in ForwardDiff.jl and FiniteDifferences.jl.
    fp_FAD = x -> ForwardDiff.derivative(f, x)
    fp_CFD = x -> FiniteDifferences.central_fdm(2, 1)(f, x)
    
    # 2. Create objects to store different quantities.
    val_func = Float64[]
    val_FAD  = Float64[] # Your code goes here
    val_CFD  = Float64[] # Hint: What data types are useful for representing lists or sequences?
    val_diff = Float64[]
    
    # 3. Compute the requested quantities for the summary.
    for x in xvalues
        push!(val_func, f(x))
        push!(val_FAD, fp_FAD(x)) # Your code goes here.
        push!(val_CFD, fp_CFD(x))
        push!(val_diff, abs(fp_FAD(x) - fp_CFD(x)))
    end
        
    # 4. Put everything into a DataFrame.
    df = DataFrame(x=xvalues, f=val_func, FAD=val_FAD, CFD=val_CFD, diff=val_diff) # Your code goes here.
    
    # 5. Return the DataFrame object.
    return df # Your code goes here.
end
```


```julia
test_func1(x) = x^2
xvalues = randn(5)

compare_derivatives(test_func1, xvalues)
```


```julia
test_func2(x) = sin(x) / x
xvalues = [k*Ï€/8 for k in 1:7]

compare_derivatives(test_func2, xvalues)
```

### Adding Visual Feedback

Now let's add a way to track progress in Newton's method.
The easiest way to do this would be to print a few values using `print` or `println`.
Here we will try to make our program modular by adding a step in the program that delegates the logging functionality to some other tiny program.
We will do this using what is known as a *function callback* -- a function passed to our program that will be called at some point using data from the Newton program.

In our code, we will add an argument, `cb`, which will be a *variable bound to a particular function*.
The underlying function will accept three arguments; that is, calling it will look like:
```julia
cb(f, df, info)
```
where `f` is the function whose root we are interested in, `df` is the derivative of `f`, and `info` is an object that contains extra information.
In this case, we will use a `NamedTuple` to store information about the state of the algorithm (see the code below).


```julia
function newton(f, df, x0; niters::Int=100, tol::Real=1e-2, cb::Function=DEFAULT_CB) # note the extra argument
    # initialize
    f_init  = f(x0)                      # initial value for function values, f(x_0)
    df_init = df(x0)                     # initial value for derivative values, f'(x_0)
    f_prev  = typemax(f_init)            # previous function value, f(x_k)
    f_cur   = f_init                     # current function value, f(x_k+1)
    df_prev = typemax(f_init)            # previous function value, f'(x_k)
    df_cur  = df_init                    # current function value, f'(x_k+1)
    T = typeof(one(f_cur) / one(f_prev)) # infer common type
    x = convert(T, x0)                   # current iterate
    converged  = false                   # indicates whether we have achieved required tolerance
    iterations = 0                       # track the number of iterations taken

    for iter in 1:niters
        # iterate
        x_prev = x
        x = x - f_cur / df_cur

        # update state
        f_prev  = f_cur
        df_prev = df_cur
        f_cur   = f(x)
        df_cur  = df(x)

        # package information into a NamedTuple?
        info = (
                iter=iter,
                x_cur=x,
                x_prev=x_prev,
                f_cur=f_cur,
                f_prev=f_prev,
                df_cur=df_cur,
                df_prev=df_prev,
        )
        
        # execute the callback
        cb(f, df, info)

        # check convergence
        converged = abs(f_cur - f_prev) < tol
        iterations += 1

        converged && break
    end

    return (x, iterations, converged)
end

# implement a default behavior for callback
DEFAULT_CB(f, df, info) = nothing
```

Check that everything still works:


```julia
newton(g, dg, 4.0, tol=1e-8)
```

Now let's write a program that displays

1. the current iteration number,
2. the current estimate for the root, `x`, and
3. the current function value, `f(x)`.

We will use the `Printf` module to help us format our strings.
To understand the formatting, note that:

- `\t`: denotes a *tab character*.
- `\n`: denotes a *newline character*.
- `%3d`: denotes a number with 3 digits.
- `.8f`: denotes a floating point number has 8 digits after the decimal.


```julia
using Printf
```


```julia
function print_cb(f, df, info)
    x, fx, iter = info.x_cur, info.f_cur, info.iter

    # add a header for the first iteration
    iter == 1 && println("iter\tx\t\tf(x)")

    # print iteration, x value, and f(x) value
    @printf "%3d\t%.8f\t%.8f\n" iter x fx

    return nothing
end
```


```julia
newton(g, dg, 4.0, tol=1e-8, cb=print_cb)
```

Our printing callback works as expected, but doing any analysis with the information printed out is cumbersome: you have to copy the information from your screen.

Next, we will implement a callback that actually stores the information for later use within Julia.
In order to avoid modifying our Newton's method program any further, we will use a slightly more advanced concept called a *closure*.
Specifically, we want to implement a function that stores information inside two arrays, but we need those arrays to be scoped within the calling function.


```julia
# define the type, which is defined as a subtype of function so that it behaves like a function
struct MyLoggingCB{T} <: Function
    xvals::Vector{T} # the first field will store the x values
    fvals::Vector{T} # the second field will store the f(x) values
end

# provide a constructor to initialize both fields with empty arrays.
MyLoggingCB{T}() where T = MyLoggingCB(T[], T[])

# implement the desired behavior
function (cb::MyLoggingCB)(f, df, info)
    # flush if this is the first call
    if info.iter == 1
        empty!(cb.xvals)
        empty!(cb.fvals)
    end

    # log the data
    push!(cb.xvals, info.x_cur)
    push!(cb.fvals, info.f_cur)

    return nothing
end
```


```julia
mycb = MyLoggingCB{Float64}()
newton(g, dg, 4.0, tol=1e-8, cb=mycb)
```


```julia
xmin, xmax = extrema(mycb.xvals)
xs = range(xmin, xmax, length=1000)

plot(xs, g, lw=3, label="g(x)", legend=:outerright)
plot!(mycb.xvals, mycb.fvals, xlab="x", ylab="g(x)", label="path", arrow=true, lw=3, linestyle=:dash)
```


```julia
# using Pkg; Pkg.add("Plots")
using Plots

struct MyPlottingCB{T} <: Function
    log::MyLoggingCB{T}
end

MyPlottingCB{T}() where T = MyPlottingCB{T}(MyLoggingCB{T}())

function (cb::MyPlottingCB)(f, df, info)
    # first log the new data
    cb.log(f, df, info)

    # now show a plot
    fig = plot(1:length(cb.log.fvals), cb.log.fvals, xlab="iteration", ylab="f(x)", lw=3)
    scatter!(1:length(cb.log.fvals), cb.log.fvals, legend=false, lw=0)
    
    # sleep a little so we can see that it happens as the algorithm progresses
    sleep(0.5)

    # make sure the figure is displayed
    display(fig)

    return nothing
end
```


```julia
mycb = MyPlottingCB{Float64}()
newton(g, dg, 4.0, tol=1e-8, cb=mycb)
```

# Additional Topics

### Broadcasting

The `.` symbol has a special meaning in Julia in that it is reserved for two operations: accessing fields of a type, or *broadcasting*.
Roughly speaking, *broadcasting* allows you to apply functions to elements of a collection individually using a concise syntax.

For example we can do elementwise-multiplication:


```julia
x = [1, 2, 3]
y = [12, 6, 4]

x .* y
```

This works for *any* function, not just operators:


```julia
function foo(x)
    return x * sqrt(2)
end
```


```julia
foo.(x)
```

Julia will try to reason about functions supporting multiple arguments where possible:


```julia
function bar(x, y)
    return x + sqrt(y)
end
```


```julia
bar.(x, y)
```


```julia
z = 4 * ones(5)
```


```julia
bar.(x, z)
```

Adding `.` everywhere can become tedious in a complicated expression, so Julia provides a special `@.` *macro* to automatically add broadasting to an expression:


```julia
z = rand(3)
```


```julia
@. x * y + z
```


```julia
w = zeros(3)

for i in eachindex(w) # eachindex(w) is preferred style over 1:length(w)
    w[i] = x[i] * y[i] + z[i] # equivalent version
end

w
```

### Macros to know about

*Macros* in Julia are functions that transform Julia code into other Julia code.
This is possible in part because Julia is written in Julia itself, using `Symbol` and `Expr` objects.
For example:


```julia
ex = :(1 + 3) # the : symbol can be used to define a symbol or expression
```

```julia
typeof(ex)
```

```julia
ex.head
```

```julia
ex.args
```

```julia
eval(ex) # evaluate the expression; you almost never have to use something like this in your code
```

The `@time` macro is useful for timing parts of your code.
To undrestand what we mean by code transformation, the `@time` macro is roughly equivalent to

```julia
t1 = time() # get time in seconds
sleep(0.1) # do something
t2 = time() # get new time in seconds
(t2 - t1) # get time elapsed
```

```julia
@time sleep(0.1); # includes information about memory allocation
```

Macros are quite an advanced topic, but here we will simply mention a few macros and describe their use:

1. `@time`: time a line of code (can be used on functions); see also [BenchmarkTools.jl](https://github.com/JuliaCI/BenchmarkTools.jl) for more rigorous benchmarking.
2. `@show`: force displaying of a variable or expression
3. `@inbounds`: turn off bounds-checking on arrays within an expression (use with extreme care!)
4. `@code_warntype`: useful for checking Julia code for type stability
5. `@.`: Add `.` to functions in an expression to induce broadcasting
6. `@assert`: Check that an expression evaluates to true; otherwise throw an error.

### A little more on types

Julia has a flexible [type system](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/types/).
As we've seen, a "type" roughly translates to "class" in object oriented programming (OOP).
In contrast to OOP, however, Julia types have *very* strict notion of inheritance: you can't extend concrete types.
Here we won't discuss how polymorphism or design work in Julia, but rather take a closer look at the anatomy of types.

There are three main classes of types to be aware of as you start with the language:

1. Composite Types: Types that combine other data types.
2. Parametric Types: Types that define a *family* of types, parameterized by some variables.
3. Abstract Types: These are just "nodes" in a hierarchy. You can define functions with them or use them in type annotations, but you cannot make instances.
For example, an `Int` is a subtype of `Real` so it sits somewhere in a hierarchy including both types.

Importantly, types can be defined at any point in time, but their structure cannot be changed once defined.
This means:

- You can edit functions that use a particular type, but not change what fields are part of the type after it's been defined.
- You can update a type's constructors. For our purposes, a constructor is merely a function that creates an instance of a type.

In the following code, note that `<name>::<type>` is a *type annotation* which declares that a particular variable has a certain type.
Type annotations can be used anywhere, including

- function signatures, which limit the type of arguments that can go into the function, and
- code blocks/function bodies, which enforce that an object must have a certain type.


```julia
struct Point2D # define an (immutable) type named Point2D
    x::Float64 # has a field x which is a Float64
    y::Float64 # has a field y which is a Float64
end
```

```julia
Point2D(1.0, 0.0) # Julia automatically defines a constructor for you
```

```julia
struct ParPoint2D{T <: Real} # define a type family where type T must be a subtype Real number
    x::T # has a field x, which has type T
    y::T # has a field y, which is ALSO type T
end
```

```julia
ParPoint2D(0,0) # type parameter automatically inferred
```

```julia
ParPoint2D{Float64}(0, 0) # note the automatic conversion
```

We can define a no-argument constructor that defaults to the origin.
Note that here we must specify the type parameter using `{T}` and state that `T` is a free parameter using `where`.
Writing `where T` roughly translates to `where T <: Any` but we could also restrict `where T <: Real` if we want. 

```julia
ParPoint2D{T}() where T = ParPoint2D{T}(zero(T), zero(T)).
```

Note that this generic version works for many data types:

```julia
@show ParPoint2D{Float64}()
@show ParPoint2D{Int}()
```

The alternative would be to write a no-argument constructor for every possible type value for `T`; e.g. `ParPoint{Float64} = ParPoint(0.0, 0.0)` which is tedious.
The generic version is guaranteed to work for any subtype of `Real`, *even types that did not exist when we implemented our type*.

One of the benefits of the Julia language is the ability to overload standard functions to take advantage of composition.
For example, it's possible to define a notion of addition with points by overloading `+`:

```julia
import Base: + # existing functions must imported explicitly in order to overload them 

function Base.:+(A::ParPoint2D, B::ParPoint2D) # we could specify type parameters but there's no need
    return ParPoint2D(A.x + B.x, A.y + B.y)
end

ParPoint2D(1,1) + ParPoint2D(2,1)
```

Now anything that relies on `+` "just works":

```julia
list = [ParPoint2D(1,1), ParPoint2D(2,1), ParPoint2D(3,0)]
sum(list)
```

### (Im)mutability and function name conventions

Every type in Julia is either *mutable* or *immutable*.
A type is said to be *mutable* if you are allowed to change its contents.
In contrast, *immutable* objects cannot have their contents changed.

For example, if we create a variable that stores the number `1` we can bind the variable to a new value *but its contents do not change* because it is immutable.
Let's illustrate this by writing a wrapper type for `Int`:


```julia
struct MyInt # structs are immutable
    value::Int
end
```


```julia
x = MyInt(1)
```


```julia
x.value = 2
```


```julia
mutable struct MutableInt
    value::Int
end
```


```julia
y = MutableInt(1)
```


```julia
y.value = 2
```


```julia
y
```

Given this behavior, you may naturally wonder how objects may or may not change if one attempts to mutate them inside a function.


```julia
a = [1.0, 2, 3]
```


```julia
function mutate_second_element(x)
    x[2] = sqrt(2) # this is MUTATION! it is shorthand for setfield!(x, new_value, index)
end
```


```julia
mutate_second_element(a)
```


```julia
a
```


```julia
@which a[2] = sqrt(2)
```


```julia
function assign_and_mutate_second_element(x)
    y = x # this is ASSIGNMENT
    y[2] = sqrt(3) # this is MUTATION
end
```


```julia
assign_and_mutate_second_element(a)
```


```julia
a
```

To understand this example, remember that `=` by itself simply *binds* a value to a particular symbol.
So, `y = x` simply means that the data attached to `x` is now also attached to `y`; no new copy is created.
Mutating the data attached to `y` is equivalent to mutating `x`.

We can test this with another example:


```julia
function copy_and_mutate_second_element(x)
    y = copy(x) # assign y a copy of the data in x
    y[2] = sqrt(17)
end
```


```julia
copy_and_mutate_second_element(a)
```


```julia
a
```

**To help programmers understand that objects will be mutated after calling a particular function, we use the convention of adding `!` to the end of a mutating function**. This lets users know that a function will mutate some arguments. Usually, we put the mutated arguments on the left of the function signature.

In fact, it is a common pattern in Julia to separate a function into allocating and non-allocating versions:


```julia
function compute_partial_sums(x)
    # create an Array with the same shape as x, but filled with zero(eltype(x)). 
    partial = zero(x)
    
    # do the actual work, storing the result in partial
    # we return whatever this function evaluates to
    compute_partial_sums!(partial, x)
end
```


```julia
function compute_partial_sums!(partial, x) # use convention; has ! and mutated argument is the first
    for i in eachindex(x)
        prev = i > 1 ? partial[i-1] : zero(eltype(x))
        partial[i] = prev + x[i]
    end
    return partial
end
```


```julia
x = [1, 1, 1, 1]
```


```julia
compute_partial_sums(x)
```

This is essentially what the `cumsum` (cumulative sum) function does:


```julia
cumsum(x)
```


```julia
partial = zero(x)
cumsum!(partial, x)
partial
```

### Type stability

A block of code, such as a function, is said to be *type-stable* if Julia is able to determine the types of all variables at compile time.
Having complete type information allows Julia's compiler to automatically generate efficient code that runs on your machine.
You can investigate type stability using the `@code_warntype` macro, which will highlight potential type instability in red (serious) and yellow (okay).


```julia
function silly_example(x)
    if x < 10
        return "ten"
    else
        return x
    end
end
```

```julia
silly_example(1)
```

```julia
silly_example(12.3)
```

```julia
@code_warntype silly_example(1)
```

Here the annotation with `Union{Int64,String}` means that the return value is either a `Int64` or a `String`, which is called a *type union*.
Julia handles minor type stability violations by introducing type unions to limit the possible space of return types.
In the *worst case* the return type will be `Any`, the catch-all when Julia is unable to infer any type information.

Let's look at a more realistic example.
Here we have a function that computes the sum of an array:

```julia
function mysum(x)
    value = 0 # initialize
    for i in eachindex(x) # iterate over the indices in x
        value = value + x[i] # sum
    end
    return value
end
```

```julia
x = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0]
mysum(x)
```

```julia
@code_warntype mysum(x)
```

This means the return type for `value` is either a `Int64` or a `Float64`.
The reason is that `value = 0` is initially an `Int64`. Then:
- if the `for` loop runs, `value = value + x[1]` where `x[1]::Float64` so `value` is promoted to a `Float64`, or
- if the `for` loop never runs, then `value = 0` which is an `Int64`.
This seems like a bad consequence of Julia's flexible type system.
However, it has a very easy fix:

```julia
function mysum(x)
    value = zero(eltype(x)) # set value to the zero of the same type as elements in x
    for i in eachindex(x)
        value = value + x[i]
    end
    return value
end
```

```julia
x = Int64[1, 2, 3]
@code_warntype mysum(x)
```

```julia
x = Float32[1, 2, 3]
@code_warntype mysum(x)
```

The type instability is gone!
Now we have a generic, type-stable function that preserves types after the sum reduction.

### Functions vs Methods

A *function* in Julia is essentially the symbol bound to a particular "action".
A *method* is a particular version or implementation of that action.

For example, the `sqrt` function will behave differently depending on the input type.


```julia
?sqrt
```

Julia lets us look up *methods* for a particular *function* using `methods`:


```julia
methods(sqrt)
```

This table shows us that the `sqrt` function has 19 different methods, each specializing on different input types.


```julia
sqrt(-1.0)
```


```julia
sqrt(Complex(-1.0))
```

### Optional arguments in functions

It is possible to define functions with optional arguments.
There are two kinds to consider:

* *Positional arguments* occur at the end of a function signature in a specific order and have default values. If the optional arguments are not specified, the default values are used.
* *Keyword arguments* begin after a semicolon `;` in a function signature. Changing the default values requires the caller to name the arguments and assign non-default values.

You can specify as many optional arguments as needed, and can mix positional and keyword arguments.


```julia
function add_number(a, b=1)
    return a + b
end
```


```julia
function also_add_number(a; b=1)
    return a + b
end
```


```julia
add_number(2) # don't specify the positional argument b
```


```julia
add_number(2, b=2) # this fails
```


```julia
add_number(2, 2) # specify b
```


```julia
also_add_number(2) # don't specify the keyword argument b
```


```julia
also_add_number(2, 2) # this fails
```


```julia
also_add_number(2, b=2) # the keyword argument must be invoked explicitly
```


### Duck Typing and Multiple Dispatch

In all our functions so far we have not specified the *types* of arguments that go into the function.
Yet, Julia is always aware of the types of arguments and variables within a function in spite of this fact.
This is known as *duck typing* and is actually a nice feature common to dynamic languages because it allows functions to be written in a generic fashion.

In many other programming languages, particularly those supporting object oriented design as it is commonly understood, there is the notion of *dispatching* to the most specific method in order to fulfill a function call.
The `sqrt` example with `Float64` and `Complex{Float64}` are examples of this.

However, this example involves pattern matching on just one argument. What's the "multiple" in "multiple dispatch" and how is it related to duck typing in Julia?

To understand this, consider the following example from [Ole KrÃ¶ger](https://opensourc.es/blog/basics-multiple-dispatch/) ([adapted from an example by Julia co-creator Stefan Karpinski](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kc9HwsxE1OY)):


```julia
abstract type Animal end

# define a Lizard type with a name field
struct Lizard <: Animal
    name :: String
end

# define a Rabbit type with a name field
struct Rabbit <: Animal
    name :: String
end

# Define the race function with 3 methods: 2 specific ones and one generic fallback
race(l::Lizard, r::Rabbit) = "$(l.name) wins in wall climbing."
race(r::Rabbit, l::Lizard) = "$(r.name) wins in a normal race."
race(a::T, b::T) where T <: Animal = "$(a.name) and $(b.name) run forever."

# Define a meet function that calls the race function.
function meet(a::Animal, b::Animal) 
    println("$(a.name) meets $(b.name) and they race!")
    println("Outcome: $(race(a,b))")
end

# Try it out with our two Animal types
bayi = Lizard("Bayi")
sally = Rabbit("Sally")
meet(bayi, sally)  # calls the first race method
meet(sally, bayi)  # calls the second race method
meet(sally, sally) # calls the generic fallback
```

Multiple dispatch lets Julia and its compiler *select the most specific method **based on the runtime types**.*
To someone coming from C++, this example makes multiple dispatch look just like function overloading.

However, implementing this code in C++ and running it reveals that C++ will always call the third, generic fallback where two animals run forever! This is because while C++ can choose a specific method, it is limited to the type information **available at compile time**. As such, adding the third method effectively erases methods one and two.

The workaround in C++ would be to make the `race` function specific to the abstract/superclass `Animal` class; i.e. we need to be able to write `bayi.race(sally)` and `sally.race(bayi)`.
This seems reasonable, but you will run into trouble as soon as you need to make an `Animal` race a `Human` because now both classes must have `race` as part of their definitions, but you may not have designed the classes with this use case in mind!

*In object-oriented languages, methods belong to class functions not just functions in general.*

In contrast, in Julia this would be simply a matter of adding `race(l::Human, r::Animal)` to handle cases as needed.
Thus, Julia rewards you for writing "weakly" or duck typed functions by letting you handle specific cases with different input types only as needed, without having to completely redesign your code.
**In fact, the preferred style in Julia is to avoid adding type annotations in your code unless absolutely necessary**.

These two points make code reuse much more probable, and is the "magic" that lets packages build lots of nice, unexpected features into them. (Feel free to ask for examples!)
