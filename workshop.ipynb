    "# What is Julia?\n",
    "\n",
    "> **The Julia Project as a whole is about bringing usable, scalable technical computing to a greater audience**: allowing scientists and researchers to use computation more rapidly and effectively; letting businesses do harder and more interesting analyses more easily and cheaply.\n",
    "> Part of that project entails creating a free, open-source language that is as easy to use as possible, so that researchers who are not necessarily professional programmers can easily create and share programs that others will be able to use for free and improve upon.\n",
    "> However, a large part of the project is also about creating an ecosystem in which such openness and sharing can take place.\n",
    "\n",
    "-- [Julia Project page](https://julialang.org/project/)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why should I care?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. It is easy to prototype *fast*, *idiomatic* code in Julia *at a high level* thanks to Julia's JIT compiler and powerful type system.\n",
    "2. Julia favors a generic programming style: write functions that assume as little as possible and compose them to write powerful programs.\n",
    "3. The Julia community is open and highly collaborative. Many high profile packages represent the joint effort of several brilliant people.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How is it different from `xxxxx`?\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax comparison between MATLAB, Julia, and Python: https://cheatsheets.quantecon.org/\n",
    "The Julia manual has a dedicated package on this: https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/noteworthy-differences/\n",
    "\n",
    "### I like `X/Y/Z` from `xxxxx` language. I don't think I can ever switch.\n",
    "\n",
    "Early on in the development of Julia, people put effort into building interoperability between Julia and other languages.\n",
    "This means that if you really need a package implemented in another language, it is possible to use it directly from within Julia.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python: Use [PyCall.jl](https://github.com/JuliaPy/PyCall.jl). \n",
    "- R: Use [RCall.jl](https://github.com/JuliaInterop/RCall.jl).\n",
    "- MATLAB: Use [MATLAB.jl](https://github.com/JuliaInterop/MATLAB.jl).\n",
    "- FORTRAN or C: Use the built-in `ccall` function documented [here](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/calling-c-and-fortran-code/).\n",
    "- C++: Use [Cxx.jl](https://github.com/JuliaInterop/Cxx.jl).\n",
    "\n",
    "The [JuliaInterop](https://github.com/JuliaInterop) organization has more packages available for other languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ultimately, the Julia language is (a very useful) tool. You should use whatever makes you productive, and your work reproducible.**\n",

    "\n",
    "**Big Picture**: Julia's *design* uses a robust type system to pass type information to a compiler that can then generate efficient machine code.\n",
    "\n",
    "The type system uses *multiple dispatch* to help programmers write generic type-stable code; type-stable code is easy for the compiler to reason about.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the surface, Julia syntax looks like any other scripting language because it is quite human readable.\n",
    "However, Julia code is much more explicit than it appears on the surface.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dr. Chris Rackauckas has [an excellent page](https://ucidatascienceinitiative.github.io/IntroToJulia/Html/JuliaMentalModel) on developing a mental model for Julia:\n",
    "\n",
    "> **A Mental Model for Julia: Talking to a Scientist**\n",
    "> * When you're talking, everything looks general. However, you really mean very specific details determined by context.\n",
    "> * You can quickly dig deep into a subject, assuming many rules, theories, and terminology.\n",
    "> * Nothing is hidden: if you ever want to hear about every little detail, you can ask.\n",
    "> * They will get mad (and throw errors at you) if you begin to be loose with the specific details.\n"

    "This seems reasonable, but you will run into trouble as soon as you need to make an `Animal` race a `Human` because now both classes must have `race` as part of their definitions, but you may not have designed the classes with this use case in mind!\n",
